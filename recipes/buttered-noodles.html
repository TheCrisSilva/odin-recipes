    <h1>Buttered Noodles recipe</h1>
    ,<img src="../images/noodles.jpeg" alt=" a photo of noodle">

    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p> Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.
    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Noodles, 
            This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.</li>
        <li> Butter,
            You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).</li>
        <li> Parmesan, 
            Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.</li>
        <li> Salt and Pepper, 
            Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and return pasta to pot.

        </li>
        <li>Mix butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper into pasta until evenly combined.</li>
        
    </ol>
